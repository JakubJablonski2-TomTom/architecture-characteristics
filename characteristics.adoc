=== Availability

How much downtime is acceptable?

99.9% - 10m 4s per week +
99.99% - 4m 22s per month +
99.999% - 5m 15s per year

Can you handle incidents manually or do you need automated way to bring your system back to life?

Does your system depend on other systems, and what is their availability?

What "available" means for the users of your system?

Can you afford to have planned downtime?

Do you have multiple tenants in the system that require different level of availability?

*Related characteristics:*

* <<Legal>> - Do you have legal requirements about availability?
* <<Fault tolerance>> - For high availability you may need the system to be operational even if something fails.
* <<Recoverability>> - For high availability you probably need the system to recover itself after a failure.
* <<Reliability>> - For high availability you usually need high reliability.
* <<Robustness>> - If the system erodes with time, the high availability may be harder and harder to achieve.
